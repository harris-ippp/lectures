+ Introduction
Machine learning is rapidly evolving, and changing the world.\\
> 1em
Algorithms use large amounts of data to `learn' the answers, by tuning parameters.  The algorithm contains no information about the solution.
- Ranking and classification (interventions).
- Playing (winning) human games (go).
- Search optimization.
- Speech and face recognition...
These are (ambiguous) optimization problems: inherently not-exact. \\
> 1em
Today we'll focus on some methods; on Wednesday we'll implement and explore a simple neural network. \\
> 1em 
This is `just for fun' -- so please enjoy it and focus on the big picture.

+ A Few Distinctions
- \emph{Supervised} learning is learning from a `training' sample by minimizing the total error (wrong answers).
- \emph{Deep} learning (opposed to shallow) is characterized by many hidden layers and (typically) unsupervised or semi-supervised feature extraction.
-- For instance: nose recognition as a part of face recognition.
- \emph{Artificial intelligence} is (my view!) a slightly older pursuit of mimicking human intelligence and interactions.  Machine learning is a subset of AI, focussing on general \emph{learning} techniques that can be applied to a range of data problems.
- \emph{Classification} problems assign (discrete) class membership; \emph{regression} problems try to learn the `right value.'
> 1em
We'll work on shallow, supervised learning for classification problems.

+ Classification Problems in Public Policy
! Use a labelled `training sample' to \\ learn to predict group membership.
Where and how to intervene?
- Voter outreach.
- Building or health inspections.
- Police training.
>1em
Note the potential tension between identification and measurement: 
maximizing discrimination v. minimizing error (real world v. academia).

+ Problems with Classification in Public Policy
- Big picture, this was a bad training sample (not enough black faces).
- It's important, when using machine learning, to study its biases.

+ Classification in One Dimension
- Consider two categories of objects separated by a single variable $δ$.
- Select objects/people/events/etc. with $δ ≤ δ_\text{cut}$ and reject others.
- Want high efficiency and low false-positive rate: \blue{$\bm{\star}$} on `ROC' curve.

+ More Variables, and Correlations Between Variables
! Seek to combine many variables \\ into a single, optimal discriminant.
- At the simplest level, you can just make a series of `cuts' on many discriminants, to isolate your signal/population of interest.
-- You can already do this with pandas masks!!
- Much better: use (non-linear) correlations between variables.
-- Linear Discriminant Analysis or Principal Component Analysis.
-- Nearest Neighbors, Binary Decision Trees, \chred{Neural Nets}.

! Analytic Multivariate Methods \\ (Not `Learning')
- You don't \emph{need} to use neural nets to achieve good discrimination.

+ Analytic Multivariate Methods
Without formal `learning' we can apply some analytical techniques to extract `optimal' cuts.
- Linear Discriminant Analysis identifies the straight lines that best separate the variables.
- Closely related to Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (two lines!), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and factor analysis.

+ Linear Discriminant Analysis: Math (for Two Categories)
The density of a multivariate normal distribution with means $\overline{x⃗}$ and covariances $M⃗$ is:
\[ f(x⃗) = \left. \exp{\left(-½(x⃗-\overline{x⃗})^T M⃗⁻¹(x⃗-\overline{x⃗})\right)} \right / √{(2π)^k}|M⃗| \]
Hence the log-likelihood ratio for membership in two sets is
\begin{align*}
& ½(x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₀)^T M⃗₀⁻¹(x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₀) + ½k \ln(2π) + ½\ln|M⃗₀| \\
& \hspace{2em} - ½(x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₁)^T M⃗₁⁻¹(x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₁) - ½k \ln(2π) - ½\ln|M⃗₁| > \text{const.}
\end{align*}
For LDA, we assume that $M⃗=M⃗₀=M⃗₁$.
\[ (x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₀)^T M⃗⁻¹(x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₀) - (x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₁)^T M⃗⁻¹(x⃗-\overline{x⃗}₁) > \text{const.} \]
Since $M⃗$ is Hermitian, $x⃗^TM⃗⁻¹ \overline{x⃗}ᵢ = \overline{x⃗}ᵢ M⃗⁻¹x⃗$, and this simplifies to:
\[ x⃗ M⃗(\overline{x⃗}₀ - \overline{x⃗}₁) > const. \]
Taking $w⃗ ≡ M⃗(\overline{x⃗}₀ - \overline{x⃗}₁)$, we classify group membership by $x⃗·w⃗ > \text{const}$.

+ Linear Discriminant Analysis: More Math Notes
- Generalizing to multiple classes (as we've used here) requires a bit more work, but (can) yield eigenvalues that correspond to the directions that yield the best separation.
-- This is how we projected to one dimension.
- Alternatively, one can query each individual class against the rest and take the winner.

+ Using LDAs in sci-kit learn 
This is implemented in sci-kit learn, with \tt{numpy} arrays:
- These arrays are what \tt{pandas} DataFrames are built on.
\pythonexternal{ex/lda.py}

+ A Second LDA Example
So long as we stay linear, we're alright.
- LDAs, PCAs, etc. may be used to maximize discrimination/preprocess for learning.

+ Limits of Linear Classifiers
- Move to a more complicated (though still somewhat contrived) generating function, but stick to two dimensions for exposition.
- With a `spiral,' the linear classifiers fail, and need something stronger.

+++ Machine Learning

+ Nearest Neighbors 
Nearest neighbors uses a labelled `training' dataset as a `dictionary.'
- Simplest case: classify new objects by matching the single closest object in the reference dataset.
- Leads to canonical \chred{over-training}: classification reflects not only the generating function, but also the statistical fluctuations of the sample.
- Therefore: average over $k$ nearest neighbors.
-- Analogous to `regularization' in neural nets.
-- \chred{$\bm{k}$} is our first \chred{hyperparameter}.
- Large training dataset translates to high precision but slow evaluation.

+ Binary Decision Trees
>1em
\\
Binary decision trees use successive splits on the input variables to partition the sample.
- The average value in a `leaf' is the output.
- Because each cut `straight,' can be useful to rotate (PCA/LDA) before training.
- Like `nearest neighbors,' BDTs are susceptible to overtraining.  One can protect against this by requiring a minimum population in each leaf.
- Unlikely, kNN, \emph{extremely fast} evaluation.

+ Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)
>1em
\\
An MLP consists of a network of nodes with activation functions, and a collection of weights for the connections between those nodes.
\[ d_k = g_k \left(Σ_{j = 0}^M w_{kj} × g_j \left(Σ_{i=0}^N w_{ji}^h x_i\right)\right) \]
<0.5em
- Activation function: sigmoid/tanh, ReLU (rectified linear unit, $\max(0, x)$), etc.
- Many hyperparameters (number and size of hidden layers, etc.).
- `Regularization' to penalize extreme weights and avoid over-training.

+ Training
We've attained some pretty magical results by `training' BDTs and MLPs to recognize patterns.
! So how does the training work!?
Define a loss as the sum of all of the mis-classifications on the entire dataset, $L = Σ Lᵢ$.  Define the element-wise loss-by
- Support vector machine: seek a gap in score of at least $X$ above other classes. \[ Lᵢ = \textstyle Σ_{j≠yᵢ}\max(0, X + fⱼ - f_{yᵢ}) \]
- Softmax: the negative log `probability' of the right class: \[ Lᵢ = - \log ( e^{f_{yᵢ}} / \textstyle Σ_j e^{fⱼ} ) \]
- Also include a regularization term that penalizes large weights: $½αw²$.

+ Minimize the Loss
Iterate over the dataset, updating the biases and weights to minimize the loss: \chred{back-propagation!!}
- Back-propagation is doing the chain-rule backwards.
-- Mainly addition with weights.  Multiplication `swaps' the gradient: the gradient on the weight is $dw = do · i$, and the gradient on the input is $di = do · w$.\footnote{If the gradient of the full output with respect to this node is $\pder{f}{q}$, and $q = xy$, then $\pder{f}{x} = \pder{f}{q} \pder{q}{x} = \pder{f}{q}(y\pder{x}{x} + x\pder{y}{x}) = y\pder{f}{q} $}
-- We'll use ReLU for our activation, which makes the derivatives easy: turns them off when paramater is negative.
-- Since we defined the regularization as $αw²/2$, its contribution is $αw$.
-- Trick is $Lᵢ$ to the scores: $∂Lᵢ/∂f_k = p_k - \mathds{1}(yᵢ = k)$.
- Save the values of all nodes in one forward pass, then work backwards.
We'll implement this on Wednesday.

+ So How Do We Set the Hyperparameters
- Training only gives us the weights.  How many nodes?  Training iterations?  Minimum leaf size?  Regularization?  Step size?
- Standard practice is to preserve a validation sample that we do \emph{not} train against, to monitor convergence.  When iterations (back-propagation) on the training sample no longer yield improvement on the validation sample, \emph{stop}.
- Also preserve a totally sacrosact test sample, that you use only at the \emph{very end} to test performance (it's easy to `tune' for the validation sample, by hand).
