+[fragile] One-Line Loops
- We've already talked about lists and loops.
- Sometimes it can be useful to combine them.
- This is called `list comprehension.'  At its simplest:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\pr \verb|print([i for i in range(10)])| \\
\verb|[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]|
\end{tcolorbox}
- This is equivalent to:
` l = [] \\for i in range(10): l.append(i)
- So: the thing on the left is repeated for each entry in the iterable.
- This is a very concise way to create useful lists.

+[fragile] Using the Variables
- You can also do simple operations, for instance, get the squares
\begin{tcolorbox}
\pr \verb|print([i*i for i in range(10)])| \\
\verb|[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]|
\end{tcolorbox}
- Or perform operations on each item:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\pr \verb|words = 'The only people for me are ...'.split()| \\
\pr \verb|print([w.upper() for w in words])| \\
\verb|['THE', 'ONLY', 'PEOPLE', 'FOR', 'ME', 'ARE', '...']|
\end{tcolorbox}
- This is still `somewhat artificial.'

+ Example 1: Sudoku (Homework)
- In this week's homework, you'll permanently solve Sudoku.
- If your `puzzle' is stored in an 81-digit list, \tt{puzzle}, what are the values in row, column, or block 5?
- Rows are easiest:
` [puzzle[5*9+x] for x in range(9)]
- Columns are pretty straightforward:
\visible<2->{
` [puzzle[5+9*x] for x in range(9)]
}
- Blocks don't lend themselves well to this (everything in moderation):
\visible<3>{
` [puzzle[(x\%3) + (x//3)*9 + (b\%3) * 3 + (b//3)*27] for x in range(9)]
}

+[fragile] Selection
- Using \tt{if}, you can control selection into the lists...
\begin{tcolorbox}
\pr \verb|num = [6, -5, -5, 10, 4, 8, -6, -5, 0, -6]| \\
\pr \verb|print([x for x in num if x > 0])| \\
\verb|[6, 10, 4, 8]|
\end{tcolorbox}

+ Example 2: Intersection \tright{ex/a/intersection.py}
- How could we take the intersection of two lists?
\pythonexternal{ex/a/intersection.py}

+ Additional `Comprehensions'
We'll mainly see lists, but the syntax applies more broadly:
>1em
- Using curly brackets, \{\}, one can also create sets ($\unsim$unique lists):
` \pr print(\{i//2 for i in range(10)\}) \\ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- With parentheses, one gets a `generator object' -- lists for which each individual element is generatedd `just in time' for you to use them:
` \pr print((i*i for i in range(10))) \\ <generator object <genexpr> at 0x102997a40>
- Generators can be very slick -- feel free to learn about them!

+++ Operations on Iterables

+ Operations on Iterables \tright{ex/a/iterable\_operations.py}
- Anything you can put in a for loop is an iterable.
- There are a few useful functions on iterables, not specific to lists.
>0.5em
- \chred{max()} returns the larget value.
- \chred{min()} returns the smallest value.
- \chred{sum()} returns the sum of all values.
- \chred{len()} returns the number of elements.
- \chred{all()} returns True if every element is True, and False otherwise.
- \chred{any()} returns True if at least one element is True.
