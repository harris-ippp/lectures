^T: Welcome: To Programming and to Python!
^ST: Lecture 1A: Welcome!
^I: Introduction to Programming for Public Policy
^SI: Intro Programming

+ Why Learn to Code?
# Technology powers the modern world.
#- Gain currency with technology so you can help govern it.  
#- What's at stake when services go wrong (VA, healthcare.gov).
#- Understand the potential of algorithms to improve policy.
# Expand your own toolset.
#- Find, manipulate, and share data to get answers and promote solutions.

+++ Coding for Public Policy
- 311 System of Boston: improve constitutent interactions and services.
- Mapping Trees in New York: making something beautiful.
- Prioritizing building inspections in New York: public safety.
- Policing in Charlotte/Mecklenberg: intervening with `at risk' officers.
- Poverty by Census tract: studying and understanding the world.

+ This is an Amazing Moment to Learn
# Governments are getting on board...
#- `One size fits all' bureaucracy doesn't cut it.
#- Modern interface for services.
#- Target interventions (money) where it's most needed.
# And they're learning to share their data.
#- Most states have \emph{some} data portal presence; many are very good.
# Software is easier and more powerful than ever.
#- Mapping, internet, etc.: making awesome stuff has never been easier.

+++ How the Class Is Structured

+ What We Will and Won't Cover
- Thinking algorithmically with python.
-- Building blocks of code from the ground up.
- First-pass of low-level tools: the command line.
- Fundamentals of databases and the web.

- Higher-level analysis `recipes.'
-- Build your own projects from large, free components.
-- Wrangle data to get and share information, and create solutions.

- However: not a management or policy course.

+ Assignments
- Weekly assignments posted on the class \link{https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/20690068-introduction-to-public-policy-30550-uc-harris}{Github site}.
- You will also \emph{submit them} through Github.  
-- There are detailed instructions in this week's homework, and we'll cover this in more detail, next week.
-- But if you have trouble with Github, speak up fast!
- Collaborative, large scale final project for exam.  I will provide templates, and you will propose the project.

+ Yes, some group work.
! Real projects require collaboration.
- Coders use Github to share work.  Using Github is a skill.
-- You don't need to be in the same place, or even talk to your partner.
- Open source software is an incredibly important...
-- Linux runs your phone; Apache is the most common web server.

+ Additional Resources 
- TA: XXX YYY (xyyy@uchicago -- but contact with Piazza!).
- XXX and I will host a `tea' (office hours) for 2-3 hours, starting from 16h on Thursdays in the Cathey Learning center. 
- Use the class \link{https://piazza.com/uchicago/fall2016/ppha30550}{Piazza} discussion board.  
>1em
- New class: I will regularly ask for feedback.  \chred{Please} tell me (anonymously, if you like) if a lecture or assignment is confusing, or if you're frustrated.

+++ Approaching the Command Line
- Please open Terminal (Mac) or Cygwin (Windows).
- If you have not yet installed this (Windows), you can use \link{http://tmpnb.org}{tmpnb.org}.
-- This is \emph{not the real McCoy}, and you will need cygwin very soon!

+ The Fundamental Commands
\Large
- \chred{pwd}:     print working directory
- \chred{cd}:      change directory
- \chred{mkdir}:   create a directory
- \chred{rm(dir)}: remove a file (directory)
- \chred{ls}:      list (files and folders)
- \chred{mv}:      move or rename a file
- \chred{python}:  run a python script
- \chred{man}:     read the `manual'
>1em
- \chred{ssh/scp}: secure connections (not in this course)

+ Notes on the Directory Structure
- \chred{`..'}: means `backwards one directory'
- \chred{`~'}: means `my home directory'
- \chred{'/'}: is `root'
> 1em
- \chred{\*}: is a `wildcard' (match anything or nothing)
> 1em
- On \chred{cygwin}, hard drive that you're accustomed to is `hidden' at /cygdrive/c/

+ Editing Text and Writing Code: Vim or Atom
- A computer executes your code by `interpreting it' or runnng a pre-compiled `binary.'
-- Interpreters: are computer programs that follow your instructions real-time
-- Compilers translate what you write into something the computer understands `intuitively' (ones and zeros = binary).
- Either way, your code cannot have any extraneous characters.
-- So, needless to say (?), Microsoft Word won't cut it.
>1em
- I propose to use \link{https://atom.io/}{Atom} (gui) or \link{http://www.vim.org/}{vim}: Vi IMproved (vi = visual).
-- The advantage of `vi` is that it's all from the command line.
-- Emacs (also command line) has many partisans, as well.
- In some cases we'll use Jupyter.

+ What is Python?
! Python is a popular \chred{interpreted}, \chred{high-level}, \chred{dynamic} programming language with \chred{automatic memory management}.
\chred{Interpreted}: computer `runs your instructions,' so you can:
- Run \chred{interactively}: execute one line of code at a time.
- Or \chred{script}: write down and save all of your commands.
- Opposed to languages that are `\chred{compiled}' into a `machine readable' executable (of 1's and 0's).
% 
\chred{Why Python?} Python hides a lot of the complexity from you.
- You don't have to worry about moving bits (1s and 0s) around: it is \chred{high-level} and takes care of \chred{memory management}.
- It is \chred{dynamic}: it figures out the \chred{types} of variables at `run-time.'

+ Creating a First Script
''' Create a file \texttt{hello\_world.py}, using vim Atom, TextEdit, etc.
''' Write \texttt{print("hello world")} in this file and save it.
''' Navigate to the directory that holds that file: \\ \texttt{cd /Users/jsaxon/Documents/...}
''' Type: \texttt{python hello\_world.py}
- To go further, we need the rules and building blocks of Python...

Through the next two lecture, we'll discuss:
! Control
! Types 
! Assignment, Operators, and Methods
Some of them will be mixed together.

+ The Building Blocks \tright{Notes: See Jupyter Notebook.}
Launch python on your computer, or open a jupyter notebook:
! Command line: `python' (must be python 3).
! Local Jupyter: Anaconda Navigator
! Online Jupyter: \link{http://tmpnb.org}{tmpnb.org} or \link{http://try.jupyter.org}{try.jupter.org}
\centering \small{Click `New' in the upper right corner, then Python 3.}
