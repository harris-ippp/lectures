+ Introduction
- Our python scripts have been `self-contained.'
- We'd like to be able to use outside data.
>1em
- Today's class will have a tiny bit of new material, and is mainly applications of dictionaries, lists, and for loops.
- In Week 5, we'll learn the python module for ``comfortably" using these types of data: Pandas.

+ Reading Files \tright ex/a/for\_line\_in\_file.py
! You have already run for loops over a file:
\pythonexternal{ex/a/for_line_in_file.py}
- The syntax \emph{is} a \tt{for} loop -- nothin' to it!
- Just \tt{open()} the file with a \tt{`r'} flag, for `read.'
- You get one line at a time, and can do whatever you want with them.
- Use \tt{strip()} to remove whitespace and \tt{split()} to list-ify lines.

+ Writing to Files \tright ex/a/canonical\_write.py
! Good news: very similar, but with ``w".
\pythonexternal{ex/a/canonical_write.py}
- The difference is that we're iterating over \emph{something else}.
- The output file is just an object, that we write to.
- There is also \tt{`a'}, for `append' (write at end of file).

+ Writing to Files: \tt{with} \tright ex/a/canonical\_write\_with.py
- You can also use `\tt{with}' to specify a block in which to write.
- The file `snaps shut' at the end of the block.
\pythonexternal{ex/a/canonical_write_with.py}

+++ Formats

+ CSV: Comma Separated Values
- Common, simple, flat, but non-standardized format.
-- Text in columns separated by a delimiter (`escape' by quotes).
-- Can be read directly by e.g., Excel.
-- There are pythong tools for this too (of course)
- We'll work with it by hand, to understand files and lists a bit better.

+ Using and Filtering Inputs \tright ex/a/for\_line\_in\_grep.py
- Let's start by reproducing our `high salaries grep' from day 1.
\visible<2>{\pythonexternal{ex/a/for_line_in_grep.py}}

+ Python: Beyond Single Lines
- Using bash, we were limited in our `global' view.
- Though we could \tt{sort}, we mainly looked at one line at a time.
> 1em
- Python lets us store variables and manipulate the entire dataset.\footnote{Truth be told, bash allows this too; it's just less fun.}
-- In future weeks we'll learn more and more tools for doing this.

+ Aggregating at a Basic Level \tright{ex/a/fire\_salaries.py}
- What was the expenditure on salaries in the fire department?
\visible<2>{\pythonexternal{ex/a/fire_salaries.py}}
- Ex. 2: modify \tt{ex/a/dept\_salaries.py} to print the total, average, and max salaries, and the number of employees.
-- Use \tt{len()}, \tt{sum()}, and \tt{max()}.

+ JSON, or, dictionaries and lists revisited.
- Officially stands for JavaScript Object Notation, but now used in many languages.
- Common format for transmitting formatted data on the internet.
- Readily manipulable in Python: just dictionaries and lists.
-- Can be `nested' dictionaries -- much like classes.
-- Often, data is packaged with metadata, and you have to `navigate down' to a list of \emph{actually} useful data.

+ JSON: File Access \tright ex/a/narco\_json.py
Loading and saving JSON files uses the same \tt{open} syntax as other files.
- Focus on reading in, for now.
\pythonexternal{ex/a/narco_json_pres.py}

+ JSON: Exploring and Accessing Data (1)
Let's explore some JSON data.  Open a python prompt in \tt{lectures/03/ex/b/}, and load \tt{narcotics.json}.
- What are the most common drug offenses (descriptions)?
-- Use a set comprehension (curly branches) to get the types.
-- Use a for loop to ask how many of each type there are.

+ JSON: Exploring and Accessing Data (2)
Now load \tt{locations.json} and \tt{elevations.json}.\\
>0.5em
These are Google API responses for geolocating the 100 largest cities in the US, and querying their elevations.
- How many cities are there, above 1 mile?
- What is the highest ``big city" in the US?
- Again, explore the data using \tt{l.keys()}.
- You'll have to find the highest city first, and then match its coordinates.
